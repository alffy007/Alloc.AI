## The Problem We Solve: Transforming your diet, one byte at a time
Many people struggle to maintain a healthy diet due to various reasons such as lack of time, knowledge, and motivation. This often leads to unhealthy eating habits, weight gain, and other health-related issues. Additionally, it can be challenging for individuals to determine if the food they are consuming is appropriate for their dietary goals.

Our solution is to develop an app that takes care of diet plans and uses AI to help the user to achieve their dietary goals. The app will use computer vision to help the user to check if the food captured fits their diet. The app will provide personalized meal plans based on the user's dietary preferences, health goals, and food allergies, if any. The app will also track the user's progress and provide recommendations to improve their diet.

The app will help users make informed decisions about their food choices, improve their eating habits, and achieve their dietary goals. By using AI and computer vision, the app will provide accurate and reliable information to the users, making it easier for them to maintain a healthy diet.
## Solution
Our solution will be a mobile application that utilizes Firebase, computer vision using TensorFlow, and ChatGPTs APIs to help users achieve their dietary goals. The app will have the following features:

### 1. Automated Work Allocation: Algorithm-based system intelligently assigns tasks to employees based on expertise and workload.

Firebase Real-time Database will be used to store employee's task and other details.

### Instant Notifications: Real-time alerts sent to employees when tasks are assigned or updated.

Telegram will be used to implement the instant notification.This can be implemented using any platform in future

### 3. Detailed Employee Reports: Comprehensive reports generated based on work history and completion times.

ChatGPTs APIs will be used to implement the auto generated reports using continous evaluation.

### Meeting Summary Generation: Automatically creates summaries of offline/online meetings and answers related questions.

### Work Status Visibility: Managers can easily view and evaluate employees' work statuses



Overall, Our innovative solution automates work allocation, real-time notifications, and comprehensive reporting, ensuring efficient task management and streamlined communication for enhanced productivity and informed decision-making.

### Railway for Hosting
Furthermore, for hosting our project, we chose Railway. Railway is a cloud platform that simplifies the deployment and management of web applications. By utilizing Railway for hosting, we were able to easily deploy our project and make it accessible to users over the internet. Railway's user-friendly interface and seamless setup process allowed us to integrate our project with their platform effortlessly. With Railway, we benefit from reliable hosting infrastructure and automatic scaling, ensuring that our application can handle incoming traffic effectively.
